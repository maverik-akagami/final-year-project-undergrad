# final-year-project-undergrad
this is a guide to my final year project in my undergrad

WiFi gives the live video feed(RaspberryPi for WiFi hub) to the phone-(Android based app for phone)
Bluetooth(Arduino based BT-module) gives the vehicle a signal for manual control-(Android Based)
The AI acts as the vehicle protector which enables the system to look for potential threats and save itself from it.
